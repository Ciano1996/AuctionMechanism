# AuctionMechanism

An auction mechanism based on P2P Network. Each peer can sell and buy goods using a Second-Price Auctions (EBay). Each bidder places a bid. The highest bidder gets the first slot, but pays the price bid by the second-highest bidder. The systems allows the users to create new auction (with an ending time, a reserved selling price and a description), check the status of an auction, and eventually place new bid for an auction. As described in the AuctionMechanism Java API.
